Governor Knowles is the current \nchairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the \nauspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of \nother distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.\n\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking \noff the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility \nplatform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have \nyou in that featured role in it works for your schedule.\n\nIt takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \n\nTony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very \nlarge for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in \nfurther on what they would like to accomplish.\n\nIf it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, \nthat would be great. \n\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. \n\nBest, \n\nDan \n\n\n", "mid" : "29970419.1075840286080.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/116.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "dyergin@cera.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968", "fname" : "116.", "date" : "2000-08-23 07:21:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: Governors Conference" }, { "_id" : { "$oid" : "52af48b5d55148fa0c199656" }, "sender" : "rosalee.fleming@enron.com", "recipients" : [ "tori.wells@enron.com", "vanessa.groscrand@enron.com", "sally.keepers@enron.com" ], "cc" : [], "body" : "I seem to have three appointments next week:\n\nTuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)\n\nWednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)\n\nThursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)\n\n\nI plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take \nawhile.\n\nRosie", "mid" : "27268321.1075840286103.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/117.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "tori.wells@enron.com", "vanessa.groscrand@enron.com", "sally.keepers@enron.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "117.", "date" : "2000-08-25 08:15:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Appointments Week of August 28, 2000" }, { "_id" : { "$oid" : "52af48b5d55148fa0c199657" }, "sender" : "rosalee.fleming@enron.com", "recipients" : [ "darlenet23@earthlink.net" ], "cc" : [], "body" : "Dar, are you on-line?

Besides help on the\ndevelopment front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a\nbuffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any\nissues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing\ndevelopment management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have\ntalked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this\nshould \"be the Authority's idea.\".  One issue is how much of our fee would\napply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much\nwould apply to the Arena.

Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.\nIf you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please\ngive me a call at 713-966-2606.\n\nAlso, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky\nbrainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options\nmarket in the commercial space market.

Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.\n2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on \nOctober 13.\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"Walker, Bruce J.\" <Walker@missouri.edu> on 08/28/2000 04:17:56 PM\nTo: \"'kenneth.lay@enron.com'\" <kenneth.lay@enron.com>\ncc: \"'rosalee.fleming@enron.com'\" <rosalee.fleming@enron.com> \nSubject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request\n\n\nThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n", "mid" : "32998721.1075840286219.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/122.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "walker@missouri.edu" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "122.", "date" : "2000-09-08 07:02:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: P.

We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\np\nidentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\nsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\nthinking around with our re-phrasing).\n\nI hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.
